What is Markdown?
=================

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
It is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else.
A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text,
without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

See [official website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for syntax.


What is markdown-oo-php?
========================

It's an object-oriented PHP library capable of converting markdown text to XHTML.


Quick start
=========

Library has two entities: _Text_ and _Filter_
_Text_ represents a piece of text which can be both markdown and html.
_Filter_ is responsible for actual transformation.

In most cases, _Text_ is enough for simple usage.

    require_once 'Markdown/MarkdownText.php';

    // create an instance
    $text = new MarkdownText();

    // set plaintext
    $text->setMarkdown($markdown);

    // or just
    $text = new Markdown_Text($markdown);

    // now you can output html
    echo $text->getHtml();

    // or just
    echo $text;


Advanced usage
==============

Internally, _Filter_ uses a set of filters which extends MarkdownFilter.
A filter is an object which can accept markdown text and return html.
You can write your own filters and use like this:

    $filters = array(
        'Linebreak',            // a built-in filter
        new MyCustomFilter(),   // child of MarkdownFilter
    );
    MarkdownFilter::setDefaultFilters($filters);

    // all transformations now use the custom filter
    echo new Markdown_Text('**Markdown is great!**');

    // you can get current filters set
    MarkdownFilter::getDefaultFilters();


Requirements
===========

  *  PHP  >= 5.3
